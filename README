JIG has evolved over several years of using and maintaining Debian
systems.  It attempts to capture in a single command line tool and
simple companion Gnome GUI various things I commonly do that relate to
managing the system. Many of the commands supported by wajig have been
gleemed from hints and gossip on the mailing lists and sometimes
nuggets of useful information from the documentation.

For a brief summary of only the most common commands try "wajig help".
The verbose version of this (wajig -v help) lists all commands.  Full
documentation is available with "wajig doc" which is q synonym for
"wajig -vv help". Online documentation is available at
http://www.togaware.com/linux/survivor/wajig.shtml.

If you experience trouble with the display, or see what would appear
to be incomplete output from wajig, consider running the "wajig reset"
command to see if that fixes the problem.

Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org> has also been incredibly helpful in
sponsoring wajig for inclusion in Debian and in suggesting new
commands. Also, many thanks to other users of wajig who have made
suggestions over the years.  I hope all have been appropriately
captured in the NEWS file.
